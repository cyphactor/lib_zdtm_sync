* Implemented the zdtm_obtain_device_info() function as part of the
general API and documented it.

* Implemented and documented the zdtm_initialize_sync() function as part
of the general API and documented it.

* Updated the zdtm_test_daemon such that zdtm_initialize_sync() and
zdtm_obtain_device_info() where used to replace the code that is now
obfuscated by those general API functions.

* Changed the names of the zdtm_open_log, zdtm_write_log,
zdtm_dump_msg_log, zdtm_close_log, and zdtm_listen_for_zaurus by
prepending an underscore(_) to their names, as to indicate that they are
theoretically private functions and are not a part of the general API.

* Implemented the zdtm_initialize and zdtm_finalize functions to be part
of the general API and to encapsulate the usage of the theoretically
private functions _zdtm_open_log, _zdtm_listen_for_zaurus, and
_zdtm_close_log.

* Documented the zdtm_initialize and zdtm_finalize functions.

* Changed the names of the zdtm_conn_to_zaurus, zdtm_send_message_to,
and the zdtm_handle_zaurus_conn functions by prepending an underscore(_)
to their names, as to indicate that they are theoretically private
functions and are not a part of the general API.

* Implemented the zdtm_connect function to be part of the general API
and to encapsulate the usage of the theoretically private functions
_zdtm_conn_to_zaurus, _zdtm_send_message_to, and
_zdtm_handle_zaurus_conn.

* Documented the zdtm_connect function.

* Changed the namse of the zdtm_send_rqst_message, zdtm_recv_message,
zdtm_send_ack_message, zdtm_send_abrt_message, zdtm_send_comm_message_to
and zdtm_send_message functions by prepending an underscore(_) to their
names, as to indicate that they are theoretically private functions and
are not a part of the general API.

* Implemented the zdtm_send_message and zdtm_recv_message function to be
part of the general API and to encapsulate the usage of the
theoretically private functions _zdtm_send_message, _zdtm_recv_message,
_zdtm_send_rqst_message, and _zdtm_send_ack_message.

* Changed the names of the zdtm_close_zaurus_conn and
zdtm_close_conn_to_zaurus functions by prepending an underscore(_) to
their names, as to indicate that they are theoretically private
functions and are not a part of the general API.

* Implemented the zdtm_disconnect function to be part of the general API
and to encapsulate the usage of the theoretically private functions
_zdtm_recv_message, _zdtm_send_message, _zdtm_close_zaurus_conn, and
_zdtm_close_conn_to_zaurus.

* Documented the zdtm_send_message, zdtm_recv_message, and
zdtm_disconnect functions.

* Converted zdtm_test_daemon.c so that it used the new general API
functions and used the new private functions when necessary.

* Converted zdtm_prepare_message_test.c so that it used the new general
API functions and used the new private functions when necessary.

* Changed the names fo the zdtm_checksum, zdtm_is_ack_message,
zdtm_is_rqst_message, zdtm_is_abrt_message, zdtm_clean_message,
zdtm_prepare_message, and zdtm_parse_raw_msg functions by prepending an
underscore(_) to their names, as to indicate that they are theoretically
private functions and are not a part of the general API.

* Converted zdtm_prepare_message_test.c so that it used
_zdtm_prepare_message rather than zdtm_prepare_message.

* Documented the _zdtm_send_comm_message_to, _zdtm_send_ack_message,
_zdtm_send_rqst_message, _zdtm_send_abrt_message, and _zdtm_send_message
functions, and updated the documentation for the _zdtm_send_message_to
function so that it better matched it's functionality.

* Implemented the _zdtm_log_error function.

* Added some logging using the _zdtm_log_error function and used
_zdtm_clean_message where people had neglected to add it.

* Debugged and cleaned up the zdtm_test_daemon application after it was
converted to use all the new library API functions. Hence, it is now
functional again!
